# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

I'm trying to create a small video game with solidity and react. Following the examples of Buildspace (https://buildspace.so/p/create-turn-based-nft-game/lessons/setup-character-data-nft)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
